# MyChatBot

This is a local chatbot that you can run on your own machine, download a model or two and start chatting.

## Setting Up

The only pre-requisite is to install Docker and Docker Compose :whale: and then just run the following command:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:8080 (feel free to change the port for the openwebui if 8080 is taken)
